- [DONE] Add Motec LD downloads
- Refactor CSV generation algorithm in telemetry_api to increase speed
- (Maybe) Add persistent socket connection from telemetry_webapp client to telemetry_api server for real-time error code checking (maybe better in Grafana -- tbd)
- Add variable hostname support via .env in telemetry_webapp
- [DONE] (just downloaded the minified .css file from github repository) Switch SimpleCSS from CDN-hosted to bundled NPM in telemetry_webapp (https://github.com/kevquirk/simple.css/wiki/Getting-Started-With-Simple.css#option-3---install-from-npm)
- Add feature to clear onboard storage of old zip files (and possibly also grafana. maybe this feature could include some kind of indication of how much storage is being used by the data in the db + the existing zip files)
- Add feature to specify motec meta info from webapp when downloading motec LD files
